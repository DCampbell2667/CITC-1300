    <h1>Bet Analysis</h1>
    <h2>NBA Bets</h2>
    <h3>Monday 3/18/24</h3>
    <p>Bet #1: (1 Unit) Clint Capela(ATL C) over 10.5 Rebounds -110 Draftkings. Clint is averaging 11.4 Rebounds last 10 games. He has hit all 5 of the last 5 games overall. 
        (13,15,14,14,11) He has hit this line 7 out the last 10 games on the road also. Lakers give up an average of 44.4 Rebounds per game which is 21st worse in the NBA.</p>
    
    <p>Bet #2: (1 Unit) Parlay Dejounte Murray (ATL SG) over 6.5 Assist + Lebron James (LAL SF) over 7.5 Assists -110 Draftkings. With Trea Young out, someone is going to 
        have to run the point. Murray should have the ball in his hands and should play decent minutes I think I can get us 7 assist. Lebron has gotten 8 assist 10 out of 
        the last 10 games(overall). Lebron has got at least 8 assists 9 out of the last 10 games at home, 9 in a row.</p>
        
    <p>Bet #3: (1 Unit) Heat +3 -112 Draftkings. Philly struggles to score without Embiid. Miami should be able to keep this game close even if Butler doesn't play. I'll take the 
        3 points and think the Heat might be able to win outright.</p>
    
    <h3>Tuesday 3/19/24</h3>

    <p>Bet #1 ML Parlay Dallas Mavericks ML + Denver Nuggets ML + NO Pelicans ML Draftkings +127 - They are all over -7 point spreads. Not sure if they all cover but they should
        all at least win. I'll just do a 3-leg Moneyline parlay and not have to worry about the cover and just go for them just to win the game.
    </p>

    <p>Bet #2 Longshot Parlay +684 2 game parlay - (Porter Jr over Alt 5.5 Rebounds + Jamal Murray over Atl 5.5 Assists + Rudy Gobert under Alt 16.5 + Porter Jr over Atl 12+ points) +
        (Kyrie Irving over Atl 20+ points + Kyrie Irving over Atl 3.5 Assists + Luka Donic over Alt 8 rebounds + Keldon Johnson over Atl 12+ points  - I lowered their last ten average
        points/rebounds/assists to where they hit the number a majority of the time. Going for the longshot today.
