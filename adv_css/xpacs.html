            <h3>Chattanooga Picks Infomation</h3>
            <p>
                I will do my best to post my picks daily. It may be NBA, NFL, or MLB. Maybe even a combination of the three. I am just trying to find what I think has the most value and has a high percentage of hitting. You don't have to tail me. Just giving out what I think has the best chance to make me profitable at the end of the day. As a sports bettor, that is all I can ask for. May the sport gods forever be in our favor!

            <h3>Legalization of Sports Betting</h3>
           <p>
            More and More states are legalizing sports betting. Which is opening the door for Sport Handicappers to start making podcast videos or joining websites to get their bets out. ESPN and other networks have created TV shows surrounding betting on sports. There are Billions of Dollars to be made in the world of sports. Sports gambling is growing more popular by the day.

        <h3>Wins vs Losses</h3>
        <p>
            Full transparency here! If I am wrong, then I am wrong. I won't try to hide it. I try to look at the long run. Am I profitable this week? or this month? As a sport gambler you have to have a short memory. If someone screwed you last time ask yourself, "What is the odds of him not hitting two games in a row?" Using this philosophy and researching statisics I try to come up with what I think has the best percentage to hit.
