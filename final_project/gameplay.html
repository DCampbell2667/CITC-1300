        <h3>Atlanta Braves</h3>
        <p>
            NRFI stands for No Run First Inning. This season the Chicago Cubs has score in only 3 out of their 11 games, thats 27%, and 1 out of their 5 games on the Road, 20%. This season the San Diego Padres has scored in 6 out of their 14 games, 43%, but at home only 2 of their 10 home games, 20%. In 11 games on the road last season, Kyle Hendricks only gave up 3 runs in the first inning, that's 27%. In 18 games at home last season, Dylan Cease only gave up a run in the first inning once, that's 6%. With them on the mound, I'll take my chances for one unit to get 6 quick outs and cash this early.

        <h3>Cleveland Guardians</h3>
        <p>
            Anthony Rizzo hit 0.338 against LHP last seaon and he's seeing the ball pretty well right now. Getting a hit in 5 out of the last 6 games overall and 7 out of the last 10 home games. He also has 5 plate appearances with 4 singles, 0.800 batting average. Jose Altuve is one of the hottest hitters in baseball getting a hit in 11 out of 12 overall games. He is batting 0.324 against RHP and 0.400 against Seth Lugo. Corey Seager has a hit in 7 out of the 9 games he has played in. He has a batting average of 0.334 against RHP. Corey is 1 out of 5 against Ross Stripling, but I think he gets a hit today, along with Rizzo and Altuve. I used a 25% boost for a three leg parlay to get +199 odds for one unit.

        <h3>Scoring Summary</h3>
        <p>
            With the higher elevation in Colorado, the ball is usually flying all over the place. Arizona has the better lineup. I think they can pull of this win today to win the series. I'll put a unit on the Diamondbacks to come out with the W.

                I will do my best to post my picks daily. It may be NBA, NFL, or MLB. Maybe even a combination of the three. I am just trying to find what I think has the most value and has a high percentage of hitting. You don't have to tail me. Just giving out what I think has the best chance to make me profitable at the end of the day. As a sports bettor, that is all I can ask for. May the sport gods forever be in our favor!

            Full transparency here! If I am wrong, then I am wrong. I won't try to hide it. I try to look at the long run. Am I profitable this week? or this month? As a sport gambler you have to have a short memory. If someone screwed you last time ask yourself, "What is the odds of him not hitting two games in a row?" Using this philosophy and researching statisics I try to come up with what I think has the best percentage to hit.
