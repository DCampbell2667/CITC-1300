        <h2>Welcome to Braves Baseball</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>April 26 is my birthday. I try to go to a Braves game every year. I have been to Truist Park the past 4 years on my birthday. They have not lost since I have been going. Knock on Wood!</p>

        <p>The past 3 years the opponent, they have played against has been the Miami Marlins. Which hasn't been a good baseball team recently. This year it was the Cleveland Guardians. Cleveland had a win vs loss record of 18-8 going into this game, which actually was the most wins by any MLB team this season. Guess who had the second most wins? The answer is the Atlanta Braves with a record of 17-6</p>

        <p>Let's just say, I was super excited that I was going to a game, on my birthday, against the two best teams in MLB at this point of the season. I was also pretty nervous, sooner or later they have to lose a game I go to right? Well Let's just say, they weren't losing this game. Let's go Braves!</p>

                I will do my best to post my picks daily. It may be NBA, NFL, or MLB. Maybe even a combination of the three. I am just trying to find what I think has the most value and has a high percentage of hitting. You don't have to tail me. Just giving out what I think has the best chance to make me profitable at the end of the day. As a sports bettor, that is all I can ask for. May the sport gods forever be in our favor!

            More and More states are legalizing sports betting. Which is opening the door for Sport Handicappers to start making podcast videos or joining websites to get their bets out. ESPN and other networks have created TV shows surrounding betting on sports. There are Billions of Dollars to be made in the world of sports. Sports gambling is growing more popular by the day.

            Full transparency here! If I am wrong, then I am wrong. I won't try to hide it. I try to look at the long run. Am I profitable this week? or this month? As a sport gambler you have to have a short memory. If someone screwed you last time ask yourself, "What is the odds of him not hitting two games in a row?" Using this philosophy and researching statisics I try to come up with what I think has the best percentage to hit.
