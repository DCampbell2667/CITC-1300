        <h2>Welcome to Braves Baseball</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>April 26 is my birthday. I try to go to a Braves game every year. I have been to Truist Park the past 4 years on my birthday. They have not lost since I have been going. Knock on Wood!</p>

        <p>The past 3 years the opponent, they have played against has been the Miami Marlins. Which hasn't been a good baseball team recently. This year it was the Cleveland Guardians. Cleveland had a win vs loss record of 18-8 going into this game, which actually was the most wins by any MLB team this season. Guess who had the second most wins? The answer is the Atlanta Braves with a record of 17-6</p>

        <p>Let's just say, I was super excited that I was going to a game, on my birthday, against the two best teams in MLB at this point of the season. I was also pretty nervous, sooner or later they have to lose a game I go to right? Well Let's just say, they weren't losing this game. Let's go Braves!</p>
