            The Atlanta Braves, an iconic baseball franchise, have a storied history that mirrors the evolution of America’s pastime. Founded in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings, they are one of the two remaining charter members of the National League1. The team underwent several name changes, becoming the Beaneaters, Doves, Rustlers, and Bees, before settling on the Braves

            In 1953, seeking new horizons, the franchise moved to Milwaukee, where they won a World Series in 19573. This victory was a testament to their resilience and ability to adapt to change. The Braves’ journey continued as they relocated to Atlanta in 1966, a move that would further cement their legacy3

            The Atlanta Braves have since become a symbol of the South, capturing additional World Series titles in 1995 and 20213. Their history is punctuated by legendary players and moments that have left an indelible mark on the sport. From Hank Aaron’s record-breaking home runs to the dominant pitching of the 1990s, the Braves have consistently showcased excellence.

                I will do my best to post my picks daily. It may be NBA, NFL, or MLB. Maybe even a combination of the three. I am just trying to find what I think has the most value and has a high percentage of hitting. You don't have to tail me. Just giving out what I think has the best chance to make me profitable at the end of the day. As a sports bettor, that is all I can ask for. May the sport gods forever be in our favor!

            Full transparency here! If I am wrong, then I am wrong. I won't try to hide it. I try to look at the long run. Am I profitable this week? or this month? As a sport gambler you have to have a short memory. If someone screwed you last time ask yourself, "What is the odds of him not hitting two games in a row?" Using this philosophy and researching statisics I try to come up with what I think has the best percentage to hit.
